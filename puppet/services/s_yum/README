s_yum::client required variables:
  $yum_mirror_url - URL prefix of local yum repository mirrors, e.g.
    http://cobbler.example.org/cobbler/repo_mirror if using cobbler mirrors
  $site_repo_url - URL prefix of locally-maintained repositories, e.g.
    http://host.example.org/repo
s_yum::client::redhat required variables:
  $rhn_mirror_url - URL prefix of local mrepo RHN mirrors, e.g.

Note on repository priorities
=============================

Yum repositories configured by this module are assigned priorities according
to the following scheme. Recall that to the yum-priorities plugin, lower
numbers indicate higher priority, and priority values range from 1 to 99 (the
latter being the default for repositories with unspecified priority).

For the most part, there should be very few overlapping packages between our
repositories anyway -- except for deliberate overrides in our special-purpose
classes (e.g. s_yum::client::mail, s_yum::client::rubyworks). We selectively
mirror only the packages we want from third-party repositories to ensure this,
so that our systems run stock, well-tested distribution software as much as
possible.

Priority 30

  Assigned to locally-maintained repositories which contain packages intended
  to override distribution-provided packages. Since by policy we do not
  override distribution packages except where necessary, there should be few
  repositories which require this priority, and most of them should be
  configured in selectively-applied subclasses, instead of the main
  s_yum::client class.

Priority 40

  Assigned to third-party repositories which contain packages intended to
  override distribution-provided packages. As above, these repositories should
  usually be configured in special-purpose subclasses, not in classes included
  on all our nodes.

Priority 50

  Assigned to operating-system distribution repositories, for example,
  mirrored RHN channels for our Red Hat systems.

Priority 60

  Assigned to locally-maintained repositories with no packages that override
  distribution packages. This includes our primary sulair repo, which is
  included on all our nodes. We already have a policy that packages in this
  repository do not conflict with distribution packages; this priority
  ordering now enforces that policy.

Priority 80

  Assigned to other third-party repositories which should not override
  distribution packages or site-specific packages. This includes most of the
  third-party repositories that we selectively mirror, including EPEL, CentOS
  Extras, RPMforge, &c.
